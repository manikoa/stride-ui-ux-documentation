# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

Stride is committed to creating an accessible experience for all users, including those with disabilities. This guide outlines the accessibility requirements, best practices, and implementation guidelines to ensure that the platform meets or exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides an equitable experience for all users.

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- All Stride interfaces must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Regular audits should be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance
- Third-party components must also meet these standards

### Legal Requirements
- Ensure compliance with relevant accessibility laws (ADA, Section 508, etc.)
- Document accessibility features for organizational compliance reports
- Maintain an accessibility statement within the application

## Core Principles

### Perceivable
- Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Create content that can be presented in different ways
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### Operable
- User interface components must be operable by all users
- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that could cause seizures
- Help users navigate and find content

### Understandable
- Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### Robust
- Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents
- Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools
- Use standard HTML elements whenever possible
- Follow ARIA best practices when HTML is insufficient

## Design Guidelines

### Color and Contrast
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)
- Do not use color as the only visual means of conveying information
- Provide visual indicators beyond color for states (focus, error, etc.)

### Typography
- Use clear, readable fonts (sans-serif fonts are generally more accessible)
- Maintain a minimum text size of 16px for body content
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or function
- Use relative units (em, rem) rather than absolute units (px)

### Layout and Spacing
- Implement responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements (minimum 44px by 44px)
- Maintain a logical, predictable layout across pages
- Design with content reflow in mind for zoomed interfaces

### Visual Focus
- Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus state
- Focus indicators should have sufficient contrast (3:1 minimum)
- Maintain logical focus order that follows document structure
- Do not disable outline styles without providing an enhanced alternative

## Interaction Guidelines

### Keyboard Accessibility
- All functionality must be accessible via keyboard alone
- Implement logical tab order following visual flow
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Ensure no keyboard traps exist in the interface

### Touch and Pointer Accessibility
- Touch targets should be at least 44px by 44px
- Provide sufficient spacing between touch targets
- Support standard touch gestures
- Ensure drag-and-drop operations have keyboard alternatives

### Time-based Interactions
- Allow users to extend time limits or turn them off entirely
- Provide warnings before sessions time out
- Ensure no content requires rapid interactions to use
- Allow users to pause, stop, or hide any moving content

### Error Prevention and Handling
- Provide clear error messages that suggest corrections
- Offer confirmation for actions with significant consequences
- Implement reversible actions where possible
- Validate input in real-time when appropriate
